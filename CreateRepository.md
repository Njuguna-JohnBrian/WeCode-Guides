# A Guide To Creating A New Repository Locally On Your Machine/Laptop

- #### For Starters All work with regard to WeCode should be in a ðŸ“‚ folder named WeCode

- #### From this folder all other WeCode projects will be created in this ðŸ“‚ folder

                ðŸ“‚WeCode
                   |__ðŸ“‚Flex
                   |__ðŸ“‚Result Summary Component
                   |__ðŸ“‚Another Project

- #### To start a project create a folder and name it as required, for this case I will use ðŸ“‚Github Tutorial so assuming that you just have one folder in your ðŸ“‚WeCode folder your structure would look like:


              ðŸ“‚WeCode
              |__ðŸ“‚Github Tutorial

- #### Then proceed to enter into the folder and you will have such a view:

- #### The next step is to open the folder in Visual Studio Code, this has various approaches:
  1. [x] Directly opening the folder with code

  2. [x] Using cmd command to open the terminal and typing code

     3. [âœ…]

     4. [âœ…]

     5. [âœ…]
       <img src="typeCode.png">
     6. [âœ…]
       <img src="opened.png">
     
  3. [x] Using the shortcut to open the terminal and type code

- #### Before writing code always initialize the repository
    - To do this you need to:
      - Open your terminal and click on __New Terminal__
        <img src="newTerminal.png">
        - This will trigger your terminal to open and by default it will be a PowerShell terminal (this is for those who did not configure a default profile)
      - Configure a default profile so that **_git bash_** is your default terminal in Vs Code
